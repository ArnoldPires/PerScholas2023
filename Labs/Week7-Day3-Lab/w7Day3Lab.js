    <li> What is a Single Page Application?
      <p>Single Page application or SPA for short is a web application or website that dynamically rewrites the current</p>
      <p>web page with new data from the web server instead of loading up entire new web pages.</p>
      <p>The goal is usually to have faster transitions and improved user experience.</p>
    </li>
    <li> What is REACT?
      <p>React is a declarative, component based, open-source front-end JavaScript library created by Meta in 2013.</p>
      <p>It's one of the most popular libraries most devs use today.</p>
      <p>React allows devs to build reusable UI components and manage the state of those components.</p>
      <p>It also uses a virtual DOM which allows it to update only the parts of the page that need to be updated, rather than updating the entire page.</p>
    </li>
    <li> What is JSX?
      <p>JSX stands for JavaScript XML.</p>
      <p>It allows devs to write HTML like code in their JavaScript files.</p>
      <p>It is usually used in combination with React.</p>
    </li>
    <li> What is Babel?
      <p>This is JavaScript compiler thats used to convert ESMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.</p>
      <p>It allows devs to use the latest features of JavaScript without worrying about browser compatibility.</p>
    </li>
    <li> What is Webpack?
      <p>It's a moduile bundler for JavaScript applications.</p>
      <p> Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset</p>
    </li>
    <li> What is Create React App?
      <p> It's a tool created by Facebook developers that helps to bootstrap a new ReactJS project by creating a new single page application with a simple configuration with one command</p>
      <p>It simplifies the process of setting up a new application and makes it much less time consuming.</p>
