	<p>Check the index.js file for solutions</p>
	<h3>While Loops - Fundamentals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use a while loop to increment count by 2 on each repetition of the block of code. Run the code block of your while loop until count is 8.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>While Loops - Conditional Expression</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Initialize a variable addThis to 0 and a variable sum to 0. Use a while loop to repeat a code block as long as addThis is less than 10. In the code block, add the value of addThis to sum, then increment addThis by 1. After the while loop runs, the value of sum should be the sum of the numbers 0 through 9.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Control Flow - if statements</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use an if statement to check if num is greater than 100. If num is greater than 100, reassign the value of final to null. Otherwise, set final to be two times the value of num.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Fizzbuzz</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Use a loop to iterate through the numbers 1 through 16. Push each number into fb, but push the string "fizz" in place of numbers divisible by 3, "buzz" in place of numbers divisible by 5, and "fizzbuzz" in place of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.</li>
	</ul>
